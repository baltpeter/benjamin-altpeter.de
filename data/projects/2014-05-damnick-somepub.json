    "description": "My forary into the world of print publishing. These are two publishing labels. Through them, I published several books authored by my mother (through SomePublisher) as well as a number of reprints of classical German literature (through Damnick Verlag). All Damnick ebooks are available for free on the website.\n\nWhile I haven't published any new books in a while, this has always been a passion project for me and I would love to revisit it in the future.",
