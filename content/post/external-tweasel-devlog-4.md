title: "Tweasel update: Request database, tracker documentation and legal research"
date: 2023-10-05T19:08:00+02:00
description: "Our tweasel updates are back after the summer. We have made our request data publicly available, such that anyone can run SQL queries against our datasets. We have also better documented many of our TrackHAR adapters. Furthermore, we have begun doing legal research to inform our decisions on how to establish tracker IDs as personal data in our complaints."
